[My Live Site](https://teelsam.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)

## Description

Here is a daily planner which could be used for a 9-5 job. Typing in your plans and pressing the blue save button saves the plans to your local storage. Also as the day passes the hour pannels change color. Grey is the past, sandy yellow is the present and green is the future. The time of day and date is displayed and continually updated through the day.
